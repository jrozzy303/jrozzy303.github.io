        <h1> WHAT'S UP WORLD?</h1>
        <p>What's up world? I'm a student at University at Buffalo. I'm putting thit site up for a course project, so basically I'm just screwing around.
        Some stuff about me: I'm from LI, New York, I have a twin brother. As for music tastes
        I am very into alternative bands, though I also listen to pop,musical theatre, and pop-punk.
        So this site is just p for now, but maybe it'll turn into something.
        Who knows?</p>
